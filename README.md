# GITHUB-PORTFOLIO
## Introduction
Greetings! My name is Kiedis, and you are currently experiencing a wonderful journey and self - discovery imagined through code.

You will see a variety of codes across different types of games. While most are inspired from pre - existing code, these projects are meant for studies and references for future bigger and bolder projects that are yet to come!

## Who Am I?
A guy who wants to make the world a more entertaining place! I specialize in game writing, game design, level design, quality assurance, concept sketches, and digital illustration!
When there are gameplay suggestions or concepts in need, you know who to call!
